I assumed that computer programming languages were very strict and that I would be using mathematical logic constantly. I was surprised to see how fluid JS really is and how many frameworks have been built and KEEP BEING BUILT that completely change what JS does and where it can go. I am really blown away."

    "text": "As a 25-year user of Microsoft Excel I never thought I would get to be the one writing the rules of the database itself. It is really fun to write database schemas and rules. After learning both postgre SQL and Mongo, I'm even happier to be able to choose the looseness of the database structure itself. And what's even wilder is that I can use Mongoose to put back a little more structure, but only as much as I want."
